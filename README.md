The Meeting App is an idea for an app specifically tailored to help simplify the administrative duties of a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. This will be an Open Source development effort inviting the recovery community input as well as community development. The whole point of Open Source is to create software that is 100% transparent to the community for outside scrunity, approval, and acceptance. The app will be free for use and the source code will freely licensed for use by anybody.

Just like the early NA pioneers created our literature from a group conscience and collective effort, we need to start creating software for our online fellowship, the future fellowship. The long-term vision is to share this app for free to the entire recovery community.

Meeting App

TLDR; A scheduling app for trusted servants with monthly reporting capabilities for business meetings.

I see this app as helpping with the scheduling and cooridination of meeting hosts/cohosts/greeters/etc. reducing the manual effort for such duties. In essence, it will function similarly to the app that restaurants use for emloyee scheduling. The host would be the server, the cohost is the cook and the greeters are the host/hostess (the analogy is for illustration purposes only).

The app will be run on device by all members of the meeting's trusted servants. Open service slots will be presented to to the user allowing them to easily accept a service slot. If a trusted servant relinquishes a slot it will become available to others to accept. Push notifications will be used to notify trusted servants of pending open slots that need to be filled for continued meeting operation.

In addition, the app will track a trusted servant's performance allowing acknowledgment of the most active and reliable trusted servants.
